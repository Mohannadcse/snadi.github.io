# Information for Prospective Students #

* I'm hiring students at all levels (Master's, PhD, and undergrad RAs). I could also potentially consider exceptional post-docs whose interests overlap with mine.
* I'm currently hiring in the area of code recommenders (helping developers use APIs -- including security APIs) and support for highly configurable software (see my work on software product lines). If you have a related software engineering topic, feel free to email me with specifics.
* Prospective PhD Students should have already obtained a Master's degree in software engineering or a related field and published at least one peer-reviewed paper. If you would like to work under my supervision, send me the a **short** summary that (1) shows you have already looked at my previous projects or read some of my papers, (2) tells me the research direction(s) you are interested in, and (3) mentions any relevant background you might have for these directions. I will usually have a Skype call with promising candidates. The call might include discussing a particular research paper.
* Prospective Master's students can contact me after applying to the UofA Master's program. Note that Master's students can be admitted unattached to a supervisor. If you plan to send a generic, automated email to all faculty members, please take me off your list. If you are going to email me, then at least go through my website and tell me which particular projects are you interested in (please do not just list keywords). In fact, you should do the same for any potential supervisor you plan to email. Few people would find generic emails very flattering :-) I might give you a small programming or reading task to do and then arrange a Skype call afterwards.
