I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. In 2014, I obtained my PhD from the University of Waterloo, where I worked with Prof. Richard C. Holt. My dissertation focused on detecting variability anomalies in software product lines and reverse engineering configuration constraints. From Oct. 2014 - June 2016, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Software Technology Group (STG) at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, working with Prof. Mira Mezini on code recommender systems and variability modelling of cryptography APIs.

My research interests include empirical software engineering, support for highly configurable software and software product lines, and helping developers use APIs more effectively. You can find more details in my <a href="{{ "/research" |  prepend: site.baseurl }}">research page</a>.</p>
